## 1. STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GUIDE

# Operating System Review Guide - Tyler, Aaron, James

## Quick Context (2 min read)

I've built an operating system to help us ship predictably without losing our creative edge. Think of it as "infrastructure for velocity" - not bureaucracy, but acceleration rails.

**Core insight:** We're great at 0‚Üí1 and polish. We need a system that handles the middle mile so we can focus on what we do best.

## Your Review Focus

### Tyler - Technical Feasibility & Developer Experience
**Time needed:** 20 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **GitHub Integration** (`.github/` folder)
   - Will these workflows actually help or create friction?
   - Are the templates practical for real development?
   - Check `stage-gates.yaml` - is this automatable?

2. **Technical Artifacts**
   - `pods/crown-trophy/engraving-flow.md` - Does the SQS/Temporal approach make sense?
   - `pods/ratio/ops-telemetry-mvp.yaml` - Realistic for brewing ops?
   - WIP limits in practice - will devs revolt?

3. **Developer Rhythm**
   - Daily Unblock & Commit - too much overhead?
   - Demo Friday format - sustainable?

**Key Question:** *"Would you actually want to work in this system?"*

### Aaron - Product Strategy & Customer Value
**Time needed:** 15 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **Stage Gates** (`Charter.md` sections 2-3)
   - Do these gates map to real product development?
   - Will this help or hinder product iteration speed?

2. **Minimum Remarkable** (`minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`)
   - Is this bar too high? Too low?
   - Does it capture what makes products worth shipping?

3. **Pod Artifacts**
   - `pods/paintbox/scope-map-v1.md` - Are these the right priorities?
   - `pods/promoteros/relationship-cadence.yaml` - Will this drive revenue?

**Key Question:** *"Will this help us ship better products faster?"*

### James - Business Impact & Scalability
**Time needed:** 15 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **ROI & Metrics** (`validation/charter-acceptance-test.md`)
   - Are the success metrics realistic?
   - 60-day targets achievable?
   - What's the real cost of implementation?

2. **Portfolio Management** (`Charter.md` + `decision-memos/`)
   - Portfolio Council structure - efficient use of time?
   - 3-paths decision framework - practical?
   - Kill switches - will we actually use them?

3. **Scale Implications**
   - Works at 10 people, but what about 50?
   - How does this affect hiring/onboarding?
   - Customer impact of this structure?

**Key Question:** *"Is the juice worth the squeeze?"*

## How to Review

### Option A: Speed Run (5 minutes)
1. Read `README_START_HERE.md` - the 30-minute adoption guide
2. Skim `Charter.md` - just the Executive Summary and Stage Gates
3. Check one pod artifact relevant to you

### Option B: Deep Dive (30 minutes)
1. Start with `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` for the full picture
2. Read `Charter.md` completely
3. Review `stage-gates.yaml` for automation details
4. Check `rollout/30-60-90-plan.md` for implementation reality
5. Look at your specific focus areas above

### Option C: Practical Test (15 minutes)
1. Pick one of your current projects
2. Try to map it to a stage gate
3. Run through the `minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`
4. Would the daily/weekly cadences help or hurt?

## Specific Feedback Needed

### Must Have Answers
1. **Deal Breakers:** What would make this system fail?
2. **Missing Pieces:** What critical element is absent?
3. **Oversights:** Where am I being naive?

### Nice to Have
1. **Improvements:** What would make this 10x better?
2. **Shortcuts:** What can we simplify without losing value?
3. **Quick Wins:** What should we implement first?

## Response Format

**Best:** 15-minute call to walk through your reactions
**Good:** Slack DM with bullet points
**Fine:** Comments in thread

## Implementation Options

### A. Full Send (Recommended if feedback positive)
- Monday: Announce to team
- Tuesday: Start daily standups
- Friday: First Demo Friday
- 30 days: Full system running

### B. Pilot Pod (Lower risk)
- Choose one pod (suggest Crown Trophy)
- Run for 30 days
- Measure everything
- Expand if successful

### C. Cherry Pick (Safest)
- Just implement Demo Friday first
- Add daily standups week 2
- Layer in gates gradually
- Full system over 60 days

## The Real Question

**"Does this system help us become the company we want to be?"**

Not perfect, not complete, but directionally correct and iteratively improvable.

---

*Review by: Friday EOD ideally*
*Decision: Monday Portfolio Council (or just us if you prefer)*

**Remember:** This is v1. We'll iterate based on what we learn. The goal is sustainable velocity, not perfection.

---

## Slack Message to Send

```
@tyler @aaron @james 

Built out our operating system draft - the infrastructure for shipping predictably without killing creativity.

**The gist:** Stage gates (Spark‚ÜíSeed‚ÜíScaffold‚ÜíShip‚ÜíScale) + WIP limits + daily standups + Demo Fridays + kill switches for zombie projects.

**Quick review:** `/candlefish-spine/STAKEHOLDER_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` (this doc)
**Full explore:** `/candlefish-spine/README_START_HERE.md`
**Deep dive:** `/candlefish-spine/Charter.md`

**Need your take on:**
- Tyler: Will devs revolt? Is the GitHub automation realistic?
- Aaron: Does this help or hurt product velocity? 
- James: Worth the implementation cost? Scalable?

**Time needed:** 15-20 min to review, 15 min to discuss

Can we sync Friday afternoon? Or async feedback works too.

Not married to any of this - let's make it work for us.

## 2. README START HERE

# üöÄ Candlefish Operating System - Start Here

**Time to adopt: 30 minutes**  
**Time to mastery: 30 days**

## What This Is

The Candlefish Operating System codifies how we ship remarkable products predictably. It's not bureaucracy‚Äîit's acceleration infrastructure.

## Quick Start (10 minutes)

### 1. Understand the Core Loop (2 min)
```
Spark ‚Üí Seed ‚Üí Scaffold ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Scale
  ‚Üë                                ‚Üì
  ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Kill Switch (if needed) ‚Üê‚îÄ
```

Every piece of work flows through these gates. No exceptions.

### 2. Label Your Current Work (3 min)
Look at what you're working on right now. Which stage is it in?

- **Spark**: Just an idea, exploring feasibility
- **Seed**: Validating technical approach
- **Scaffold**: Building core functionality  
- **Ship**: Polishing for production
- **Scale**: Optimizing what's live

Add the appropriate label to your GitHub issues/PRs.

### 3. Join Tomorrow's Standup (2 min)
At 10:00 AM PST, post in #unblock-and-commit:

```
‚úÖ Completed Yesterday: [What you finished]
üöß Blocked On: [What's stopping you, tag owner]
üìù Committing Today: [What you'll complete]
```

### 4. Book Demo Friday Slot (2 min)
If you'll ship something this week, claim a Demo Friday slot in #demo-friday.
Remember: Live demos only, no slides.

### 5. Add One Idea (1 min)
Think of one improvement, feature, or fix. Add it to the Idea Ledger (link in #operations).

**Congrats! You're now operating in the system.** üéâ

## FAQ

### "This feels like too much process"
It's actually less process‚Äîit's just visible now. You're already doing these things; we're making them systematic so you don't have to think about them.

### "What if I don't know what gate something is in?"
Ask in #operations or DM @integrator-pod. When in doubt, start with Spark.

### "Do I have to do the daily standup?"
Yes, but it takes 2 minutes. The ROI is huge‚Äîblockers get resolved faster.

### "What if I can't demo on Friday?"
That's fine! Demo when you have something to show. But aim for at least once a month.

### "Can I skip gates?"
No. Gates ensure quality and prevent waste. But gates can progress quickly if criteria are met.

### "Who decides gate progression?"
- Spark ‚Üí Seed: You + Pod Lead
- Seed ‚Üí Scaffold: Integrator Pod
- Scaffold ‚Üí Ship: Pod Lead + Integrator Pod
- Ship ‚Üí Scale: Portfolio Council

### "What if something gets killed?"
That's success, not failure. We learned something and freed resources for better work.

## Get Help

### Immediate Help
- **Slack**: #operations (monitored continuously)
- **DM**: @integrator-pod
- **Emergency**: @patrick

### Learning Resources
- Weekly office hours: Tuesdays 3pm

## Success Metrics

You'll know you've mastered the system when:
- Your work flows predictably through gates
- You're never blocked for >24 hours
- You ship something every 2-3 weeks
- Your demos get "oohs" and "ahhs"
- You help others navigate the system

## First Day Action Items

**Right now (5 min):**
1. Label your current work with a stage gate
2. Join #unblock-and-commit and #demo-friday
3. Add tomorrow's standup to your calendar

**Tomorrow (10 min):**
1. Post your standup update at 10am
2. Read one runbook relevant to your work
3. Add an idea to the Idea Ledger

**This week (30 min):**

2. Attend Demo Friday (or watch recording)
3. Help resolve someone's blocker

## Why This Matters

We're building a company that ships remarkable products predictably. This system is how we:
- Maintain creative edge while scaling
- Prevent burnout through sustainable pace
- Ensure everything we ship is remarkable
- Build a company worth being part of

You're not just following a process‚Äîyou're building an institution.

## 3. OPERATING CHARTER

# Candlefish Operating Charter
*Version 1.0 | Generated: 2025-08-31*

## Executive Summary

Candlefish operates as a dual-engine organization: Patrick drives Spark & Elevation while our System delivers Integration & Finish. This charter codifies how we ship remarkable products predictably without sacrificing creative edge.

## Operating Archetype

### Dual-Engine Model
- **Engine 1: Spark & Elevation** (Patrick)
  - 0‚Üí1 creation
  - Polish passes
  - Strategic vision
  - Quality elevation

- **Engine 2: Integration & Finish** (System)
  - Middle-mile execution
  - Cross-pod coordination
  - Delivery cadence
  - Operational excellence

## Stage-Gate Framework

### Gate Progression
**Spark ‚Üí Seed ‚Üí Scaffold ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Scale**

Each gate enforces explicit criteria before promotion. No skipping gates. Kill-switches activate automatically on criteria breach.

### Gate Definitions

#### Spark Gate
- **Purpose**: Capture and qualify ideas
- **Entry**: Problem statement + hypothesis
- **Exit**: Strategic fit score ‚â•3/5, Impact ‚â•3/5
- **Artifacts**: Idea Ledger entry, initial POV
- **Review**: Weekly during Unblock & Commit
- **Auto-kill**: No progress for 30 days

#### Seed Gate
- **Purpose**: Validate feasibility
- **Entry**: Approved Spark
- **Exit**: Technical spike complete, dependency map
- **Artifacts**: Decision Memo, risk assessment
- **Review**: Integrator Pod sign-off
- **Auto-kill**: Blocking dependencies unresolved for 14 days

#### Scaffold Gate
- **Purpose**: Build foundation
- **Entry**: Approved Seed with owner assigned
- **Exit**: Core functionality working, test coverage >60%
- **Artifacts**: API contracts, acceptance tests, demo recording
- **Review**: Demo Friday presentation
- **Auto-kill**: Failed acceptance tests for 7 days

#### Ship Gate
- **Purpose**: Polish and release
- **Entry**: Scaffold complete, Minimum Remarkable checklist started
- **Exit**: All checklist items green, production deployed
- **Artifacts**: Release notes, support runbook, metrics dashboard
- **Review**: Portfolio Council approval
- **Auto-kill**: Customer-impacting bugs unresolved for 48 hours

#### Scale Gate
- **Purpose**: Optimize and expand
- **Entry**: Shipped with 30-day stability
- **Exit**: Performance targets met, operational handoff complete
- **Artifacts**: Optimization report, scaling plan
- **Review**: Quarterly business review
- **Auto-kill**: SLA violations for 3 consecutive days

## WIP Limits

### System Constraints
- **Per Pod**: Maximum 3 items in Scaffold stage

- **Cross-Pod**: Maximum 5 active Seed explorations
- **Portfolio**: Maximum 10 total items in flight

### Enforcement
- GitHub Actions block new work when limits exceeded
- Weekly review identifies constraint violations
- Automatic prioritization forcing function on breach

## Kill-Switch Protocol

### Automatic Triggers
1. **Time-based**: Stage timeout exceeded
2. **Quality-based**: Minimum Remarkable violations
3. **Resource-based**: 2x effort overrun
4. **Strategic-based**: Fit score drops below 2/5

### Graceful Shutdown

## 12. DAILY UNBLOCK COMMIT

# Daily Unblock & Commit
*Version: 1.0 | Generated: 2025-08-31*

## Overview
**Time:** 10:00 PST (17:00 UTC)
**Duration:** 15 minutes maximum
**Format:** Async Slack thread in #unblock-and-commit
**Attendance:** All active contributors

## Purpose
- Surface blockers before they become critical
- Create public commitment to daily progress
- Enable rapid cross-pod assistance
- Maintain momentum

## Format

### Thread Template
```
üéØ **Daily Unblock & Commit** - [Date]

Post your update using this format:

‚úÖ **Completed Yesterday:**
- 

üöß **Blocked On:**
- 

üìù **Committing to Today:**
- 
```

### Response Format
Each person posts one message with three sections:

**‚úÖ Completed Yesterday**
- Specific, measurable accomplishments
- Link to PR/commit/demo if applicable
- Gate progressions achieved

**üöß Blocked On**
- Specific blocker with context
- What you've tried
- Who/what you need
- Time blocked

**üìù Committing to Today**
- 1-3 specific deliverables
- Must be achievable in one day
- Include gate/stage if applicable

## Rules

### Participation
- Post by 10:15 PST or marked absent
- Weekend/PTO excluded
- Missing 2 days without notice = escalation

### Blockers
- Tag specific person who can unblock
- Escalate if blocked >24 hours
- Integrator Pod monitors all blockers
- Patrick reviews blockers >48 hours

### Commitments
- Must be specific and measurable
- "Work on X" not acceptable
- "Complete Y section of X" acceptable
- Previous commitments auto-carried if not mentioned

## Escalation

### 24-Hour Blockers
1. Integrator Pod DMs blocker owner
2. Adds to afternoon sync agenda
3. Creates tracking issue

### 48-Hour Blockers
1. Patrick notified
2. Pod Lead meeting scheduled
3. Resource reallocation considered

### Pattern Detection
- 3+ similar blockers = systemic issue
- Added to Portfolio Council agenda
- Root cause analysis required

## Examples

### Good Update
```
‚úÖ Completed Yesterday:
- Shipped PR #234 for auth integration
- Fixed 3 critical bugs in photo upload
- Recorded demo for Friday presentation

üöß Blocked On:
- AWS credentials for staging deploy (need @ops-team, blocked 18hrs)
- API contract review from @mike (sent Monday)

üìù Committing to Today:
- Complete test coverage for auth module
- Review and merge Lisa's PWA changes
- Start Seed gate documentation
```

### Poor Update
```
‚úÖ Completed: Worked on stuff
üöß Blocked: Waiting on things
üìù Today: Continue working
```

## Metrics Tracked
- Blocker resolution time
- Commitment completion rate
- Participation rate
- Cross-pod assistance frequency

## Bot Automation
```javascript
// Slack bot posts thread at 10:00 PST
// Reminder at 10:10 for non-responders
// Summary posted at 10:30
// Blockers compiled for afternoon sync
```

## Integration Points
- Blockers feed Portfolio Council
- Commitments update GitHub projects
- Completions trigger Demo Friday eligibility
- Patterns inform retrospectives

## 15. UNIFIED AUTH DECISION

# Decision Memo: Unified Authentication System
*Date: 2025-08-31 | Owner: Integrator Pod | Status: Approved*

## Context
Each pod currently maintains separate authentication systems with different security standards, user experiences, and maintenance overhead. Recent security audit identified this as our highest risk area with 3 near-miss incidents in Q2.

## Decision Required
How should we implement unified authentication across all Candlefish products?

## Three Paths

### Path 1: Build Custom Auth Service
**Description:** Build our own authentication service from scratch using industry best practices.

**Pros:**
- Complete control over implementation
- Perfect fit for our specific needs
- No vendor lock-in
- Can monetize as separate product

**Cons:**
- 3-4 month development time
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Security responsibility on us
- Compliance complexity (SOC2, GDPR)

**Cost:** $120k development + $30k/year maintenance
**Timeline:** 4 months

### Path 2: Auth0/Okta Integration
**Description:** Integrate enterprise auth provider across all services.

**Pros:**
- Production-ready immediately
- Enterprise-grade security
- Compliance handled
- 24/7 support

**Cons:**
- $48k/year at our scale
- Vendor lock-in risk
- Limited customization
- Per-user pricing model

**Cost:** $48k/year + $15k integration
**Timeline:** 3 weeks

### Path 3: Open Source (Keycloak/Ory)
**Description:** Deploy open-source identity platform with custom integrations.

**Pros:**
- No licensing costs
- Highly customizable
- Active community
- Self-hosted control

**Cons:**
- Complex deployment
- Requires auth expertise
- Self-support model
- Scaling challenges

**Cost:** $40k setup + $20k/year operations
**Timeline:** 6 weeks

## Recommendation
**Path 2: Auth0 Integration**

Rationale:
- Fastest path to eliminating security risk
- Total 3-year cost lowest when including engineering time
- Allows team to focus on core product differentiation
- Can migrate away if needed (standard protocols)

## Reversibility
**Reversible with effort** - OIDC/SAML standards mean we can migrate, but would require coordinated effort across all pods (estimated 2-3 weeks).

## Success Metrics
1. Zero security incidents related to authentication
2. Single sign-on working across all products within 30 days
3. Customer satisfaction score for login experience >4.5/5
4. Support tickets related to auth reduced by 75%

## Next Steps
1. Negotiate enterprise agreement with Auth0
2. Create integration roadmap by pod
3. Set up staging environment
4. Begin Crown Trophy integration as pilot

## 16. AI PREVIEW DECISION

# Decision Memo: AI-Powered Engraving Preview
*Date: 2025-08-31 | Owner: Sarah Chen | Status: In Review*

## Context
Crown Trophy loses 35% of custom engraving orders at checkout when customers can't visualize the final product. Competitors offer basic text previews but nothing photorealistic. Customer interviews show visualization is the #1 requested feature.

## Decision Required
Which approach should we take for implementing AI-powered engraving previews?

## Three Paths

### Path 1: Stable Diffusion Fine-Tuning
**Description:** Fine-tune open-source Stable Diffusion on our catalog of 10,000+ engraved products.

**Pros:**
- Photorealistic quality
- No per-generation costs
- Complete control
- Can run edge/local

**Cons:**
- GPU infrastructure needed
- 2-3 second generation time
- Training complexity
- Model drift over time

**Cost:** $30k setup + $2k/month GPU costs
**Timeline:** 8 weeks

### Path 2: OpenAI/Anthropic API
**Description:** Use commercial API with prompt engineering for real-time generation.

**Pros:**
- No infrastructure
- Best-in-class quality
- Continuous improvements
- Sub-second response

**Cons:**
- Per-request costs
- Internet dependency
- Potential rate limits
- Less control over output

**Cost:** $0.02/preview √ó 50k/month = $1k/month
**Timeline:** 2 weeks

### Path 3: Hybrid Template System
**Description:** Pre-render common combinations, use AI only for unique requests.

**Pros:**
- Instant for 80% of requests
- Predictable costs
- Fallback options
- Progressive enhancement

**Cons:**
- Complex caching logic
- Storage requirements
- Partial coverage
- Maintenance overhead

**Cost:** $5k setup + $500/month
**Timeline:** 4 weeks

## Recommendation
**Path 3: Hybrid Template System**

Rationale:
- Best user experience (instant for majority)
- Manageable costs that scale with usage
- Can start simple and enhance over time
- Reduces dependency on external services

## Reversibility
**Easily reversible** - Display layer abstraction means we can swap generation methods without touching UI code.

## Success Metrics
1. Checkout conversion increase of 25%+
2. Preview generation time <500ms for 80% of requests
3. Customer satisfaction with preview accuracy >4.0/5
4. Cost per conversion <$0.10

## Next Steps
1. Analyze top 1000 engraving patterns
2. Build template generation pipeline
3. Implement caching layer
4. A/B test with 10% of traffic

## 17. MOBILE CAPTURE DECISION

# Decision Memo: Mobile Photo Capture Workflow
*Date: 2025-08-31 | Owner: Lisa Park | Status: Approved*

## Context
Field teams document 500+ items daily using consumer camera apps then manually upload, causing 2-hour daily overhead and frequent data loss. Current workflow has 15% error rate and blocks real-time inventory updates.

## Decision Required
Should we build native mobile apps or use progressive web app (PWA) approach?

## Three Paths

### Path 1: Native iOS/Android Apps
**Description:** Build dedicated React Native apps for both platforms.

**Pros:**
- Best camera integration
- Offline-first architecture  
- Push notifications
- App store presence

**Cons:**
- App store approval delays
- Update distribution challenges
- Dual platform maintenance
- Device testing matrix

**Cost:** $80k development + $20k/year maintenance
**Timeline:** 12 weeks

### Path 2: Progressive Web App (PWA)
**Description:** Enhance existing web app with PWA capabilities and camera APIs.

**Pros:**
- Single codebase
- Instant updates
- No app store friction
- Works on any device

**Cons:**
- iOS camera limitations
- No app store discovery
- Browser compatibility issues
- Less native feel

**Cost:** $30k development + $5k/year maintenance
**Timeline:** 4 weeks

### Path 3: Hybrid - PWA First, Native Later
**Description:** Launch PWA immediately, develop native apps for power users.

**Pros:**
- Quick initial deployment
- Learn from PWA usage
- Progressive enhancement
- Risk mitigation

**Cons:**
- Eventually maintaining both
- Potential user confusion
- Feature parity challenges
- Longer total timeline

**Cost:** $35k PWA + $60k native later
**Timeline:** 4 weeks PWA, +8 weeks native

## Recommendation
**Path 2: Progressive Web App**

Rationale:
- 3x faster time to value
- Covers 95% of use cases adequately
- Can always add native if needed
- Dramatically lower maintenance burden
- Recent iOS improvements make PWA viable

## Reversibility
**Easily reversible** - PWA components can be wrapped in React Native shell if native becomes necessary.

## Success Metrics
1. Photo capture time reduced by 50%
2. Error rate reduced to <2%
3. 100% of field team using within 30 days
4. Zero data loss incidents
5. Offline sync success rate >98%

## Next Steps
1. Implement MediaStream API integration
2. Add service worker for offline
3. Deploy to staging for field testing
4. Create training materials
5. Phased rollout by region

### FAQ Response Template
```
Great question about [topic]. 

The short answer: [Answer]

Details in the Charter section: [Link to section]

Happy to discuss further in our next sync.
```

### Resistance Response
```
I hear the concern about process overhead.

The system is designed to reduce friction, not add it:
‚Ä¢ Gates auto-progress when criteria are met
‚Ä¢ WIP limits prevent context-switching 
‚Ä¢ Kill switches free you from zombie projects

Let's try it for 30 days and adjust based on data.

## Demo Qualification Reminder

```
üí° **What Makes a Valid Demo?**

Seeing confusion about demo requirements. Quick reminder:

‚úÖ **Valid:**
‚Ä¢ Live software (even if rough)
‚Ä¢ Real user interactions
‚Ä¢ Actual data/API calls
‚Ä¢ Failed experiments with learnings
‚Ä¢ Performance improvements

‚ùå **Not Valid:**
‚Ä¢ Slides/presentations
‚Ä¢ Mockups/designs
‚Ä¢ Future plans
‚Ä¢ Status updates
‚Ä¢ "It works on my machine" without showing

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't let someone else try it, it's not ready to demo.

Questions? Ask here or DM @integrator-pod

## 24. CROWN TROPHY ENGRAVING FLOW

# Crown Trophy Engraving Job Flow
*Version: 1.0 | Generated: 2025-08-31*

## Overview
End-to-end workflow for engraving jobs using SQS/Temporal orchestration.

## Architecture

## SQS Configuration

```yaml

    delay_seconds: 0
    visibility_timeout: 300
    message_retention: 14_days

    customer_id: string
    item_id: string
    text: array
    artwork_url: string
    rush: boolean
    due_date: string
```

## Temporal Workflow Definition

```typescript
// workflows/engravingWorkflow.ts
import { proxyActivities, sleep } from '@temporalio/workflow';

const activities = proxyActivities({
  startRetryOptions: {
    initialInterval: '1s',
    backoffCoefficient: 2,
    maximumAttempts: 3,
  },
});

export async function engravingWorkflow(job: EngravingJob) {
  // Step 1: Validate job
  await activities.validateJob(job);
  
  // Step 2: Design if needed
  if (job.requiresDesign) {
    const design = await activities.createDesign(job);
    
    // Step 3: Get approval
    const approved = await activities.getApproval(design);
    if (!approved) {
      await activities.requestRevision(design);
      return { status: 'revision_requested' };
    }
  }
  
  // Step 4: Send to engraving
  await activities.sendToMachine(job);
  
  // Step 5: Quality check
  const qaResult = await activities.qualityCheck(job);
  if (!qaResult.passed) {
    await activities.reengrave(job);
  }
  
  // Step 6: Mark complete
  await activities.markComplete(job);
  
  return { status: 'complete', job_id: job.id };
}
```

## Activity Implementations

```typescript
// activities/engravingActivities.ts

export async function validateJob(job: EngravingJob): Promise<void> {
  // Check inventory
  const item = await db.items.findOne({ id: job.item_id });
  if (!item || item.stock.available < 1) {
    throw new Error('Item not available');
  }
  
  // Validate text fits
  if (job.text.length > item.engraving_area.max_lines) {
    throw new Error('Text exceeds maximum lines');
  }
}

export async function createDesign(job: EngravingJob): Promise<Design> {
  // Generate preview using AI
  const preview = await generateAIPreview({
    item: job.item_id,
    text: job.text,
    font: job.font,
  });
  
  // Save design
  const design = await db.designs.create({
    job_id: job.id,
    preview_url: preview.url,
    status: 'pending_approval',
  });
  
  // Notify customer
  await sendNotification(job.customer_id, {
    type: 'design_ready',
    preview_url: preview.url,
  });
  
  return design;
}

export async function sendToMachine(job: EngravingJob): Promise<void> {
  // Queue for physical engraving
  await machineQueue.send({
    priority: job.rush ? 1 : 5,
    job_id: job.id,
    machine_id: selectBestMachine(job),
    estimated_time: calculateEngraveTime(job),
  });
  
  // Wait for completion
  await waitForMachineComplete(job.id);
}

## User Stories (Top 3 to Ship)

### Story 1: Quick Quote to Contract
```gherkin
Feature: Convert estimate to contract in one flow

  As a painting contractor
  I want to create an estimate and convert it to a contract
  So that I can close deals faster

  Scenario: Create and send estimate
    Given I have a new client inquiry
    When I create an estimate with line items
    And I add photos and scope details
    Then I can send it via email/SMS
    And track when it's viewed

  Scenario: Client accepts estimate
    Given client views the estimate
    When they click "Accept"
    Then it converts to a contract
    And collects digital signature
    And schedules initial payment

  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Estimate creation <2 minutes
    - Mobile-responsive client view
    - Legal contract generation
    - Payment processing integration
    - Email/SMS notifications
```

### Story 2: Photo Progress Documentation

Feature: Document project progress with photos

  As a painting contractor
  I want to capture progress photos easily
  So that I can document work for clients and protect myself

  Scenario: Capture before/during/after
    Given I'm on a job site
    When I open the mobile app
    Then I can capture photos with labels
    And they auto-organize by project/room
    And sync when connection available

  Scenario: Share with client
    Given I have progress photos
    When I select photos to share
    Then client receives update
    And can comment/approve
    And history is maintained

  Acceptance Criteria:

  I want to efficiently schedule crews
  So that I maximize productivity and minimize downtime

  Scenario: Schedule multi-day project
    Given I have a 5-day project
    When I assign crew members
    Then system checks availability
    And warns of conflicts
    And suggests optimal schedule

  Scenario: Handle weather delays
    Given rain is forecast
    When I check schedule

## 28. KILL SWITCH RUNBOOK

# Kill Switch Runbook
*Version: 1.0 | Generated: 2025-08-31*

## Purpose
Gracefully terminate projects that no longer meet success criteria while preserving learnings and reusable components.

## Automatic Triggers

### Time-Based Kills
| Stage | Trigger | Grace Period |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Spark | No update for 30 days | 7 days |
| Seed | Blocked for 14 days | 3 days |
| Scaffold | Tests failing for 7 days | 24 hours |
| Ship | Customer bugs for 48 hours | 0 (immediate) |
| Scale | SLA violations for 3 days | 0 (immediate) |

### Quality-Based Kills
- Minimum Remarkable score <3/10
- Test coverage drops below 40%
- Security vulnerabilities marked critical
- Performance regression >50%

### Strategic Kills
- Strategic fit score drops below 2/5
- Effort estimate exceeds 3x original
- Dependencies become unavailable
- Market conditions change materially

## Kill Switch Process

### 1. Detection (Automated)
```yaml
trigger_detected:
  - GitHub Action identifies trigger condition
  - Notification sent to owner and pod lead
  - Grace period timer starts
  - Issue labeled with 'kill-review'
```

### 2. Grace Period Response
**Owner has grace period to:**
- Fix the triggering condition
- Request exception with justification
- Propose pivot/rescope
- Accept termination

**Exception Request Template:**
```markdown
## Kill Switch Exception Request
**Project:** [Name]
**Trigger:** [What triggered kill switch]
**Resolution Plan:** [How you'll fix it]
**Timeline:** [When it will be fixed]
**Why Continue:** [Business justification]
**Risk Accepted By:** @stakeholder
```

### 3. Termination Execution

#### A. Code Preservation
```bash
# Create archive branch
git checkout -b archive/[project-name]-[date]
git push origin archive/[project-name]-[date]

# Move to experiments folder
mkdir -p experiments/[year]/[project-name]
mv src/[project-files] experiments/[year]/[project-name]/
git add -A
git commit -m "Archive: [project-name] - Kill switch triggered by [reason]"

# Tag for reference
git tag -a killed/[project-name] -m "Killed: [reason]"
git push --tags
```

#### B. Documentation
Create `/experiments/[year]/[project-name]/POSTMORTEM.md`:
```markdown
# [Project Name] Postmortem
**Killed Date:** [Date]
**Trigger:** [What triggered termination]
**Stage at Death:** [Gate]
**Resources Invested:** [Time/Money]

## What We Tried
[Approach and implementation details]

## Why It Failed
[Root cause analysis]

## What We Learned
1. [Learning 1]
2. [Learning 2]
3. [Learning 3]

## Reusable Components
- `[component]` - [how it can be reused]
- `[pattern]` - [where it applies]

## Recommendations
[What to do differently next time]
```

#### C. Resource Recovery
1. **AWS Resources**
   - Terminate EC2 instances
   - Delete unused RDS databases
   - Remove S3 buckets (after backup)
   - Cancel reserved instances

2. **External Services**
   - Cancel API subscriptions
   - Remove webhooks
   - Delete OAuth apps
   - Close vendor accounts

3. **Team Resources**
   - Reassign owner to new project
   - Update capacity planning
   - Cancel recurring meetings
   - Archive Slack channels

### 4. Salvage Operations

#### Component Extraction
```bash
# Identify reusable components
grep -r "export" src/ | grep -E "(class|function|const)" > reusable.txt

# Extract to shared library
mkdir -p packages/shared/[component-name]
cp [reusable-files] packages/shared/[component-name]/

# Update package.json
npm init -y
npm publish --access=private
```

#### Data Preservation
```sql
-- Backup any valuable data
CREATE TABLE archive.[project_name]_backup AS
SELECT * FROM production.[project_tables];

-- Document data schema
\d+ [table_name] > schema_backup.sql
```

#### Learning Capture
1. Schedule retrospective within 48 hours
2. Document patterns to avoid
3. Update decision criteria
4. Share learnings in Demo Friday

Full postmortem: [link]
```

## Appeal Process

### When to Appeal
- New information materially changes the situation
- Triggering condition was measurement error
- Customer commits to usage/payment
- Strategic priority changes

### Appeal Requirements
1. Decision memo with three paths
2. Sponsor at VP level or higher
3. Concrete plan to avoid future triggers
4. Success metrics with timeline

### Appeal Review
- Portfolio Council special session
- Majority vote required
- One appeal per project maximum
- Decision final

## Metrics to Track

### Kill Metrics
- Time from trigger to termination
- Resources recovered (hours/dollars)
- Components salvaged
- Learnings documented

### Pattern Analysis
- Most common kill triggers
- Average stage at termination
- Correlation with initial scores
- False positive rate

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technical Impossibility
**Trigger:** Core assumption proved false
**Response:** Immediate termination, extract learnings
**Salvage:** Document anti-patterns

### Scenario 2: Market Change
**Trigger:** Customer need disappeared
**Response:** Pivot exploration, then terminate
**Salvage:** Repurpose for adjacent need

### Scenario 3: Resource Constraint
**Trigger:** Key person left, no replacement
**Response:** Pause, attempt handoff, then terminate
**Salvage:** Documentation and partial implementation

### Scenario 4: Quality Failure
**Trigger:** Cannot meet performance requirements
**Response:** One spike to fix, then terminate
**Salvage:** Test suite and benchmarks

## Prevention Strategies

### Early Detection
- Weekly score review
- Automated health checks
- Regular customer validation
- Dependency monitoring

### Risk Mitigation
- Smaller initial scopes
- Proof of concept first
- Customer development parallel
- Regular pivot evaluation

---

*"Kill quickly, learn completely, move forward."*

**Remember:** Killing projects isn't failure‚Äîit's portfolio optimization. The faster we kill the wrong things, the more resources we have for the right things.

**Participants:** [List]

### Questions to Ask:
1. What external services will this call?
2. What internal APIs does this need?
3. What data sources are required?
4. Who needs to approve decisions?
5. What could block deployment?
6. What happens if X is unavailable?

### Output:
- Initial dependency list
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation strategies
```

### Step 2: Create Visual Map
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Service] -->|auth| B[Auth API]
    A -->|data| C[Database]
    A -->|files| D[S3]
    A -->|ai| E[OpenAI]
    
    B -->|blocking| A
    C -->|blocking| A
    D -->|degraded| A
    E -->|fallback| F[Cache]
    
    style B fill:#f96
    style C fill:#f96
    style D fill:#ff9
    style E fill:#9f9
```

### Step 3: Document in Repository
Create `/docs/dependencies.md`:
```markdown
# [Project] Dependencies

## Critical Path (Blocking)
These must be available for service to function:
- Authentication Service (99.9% SLA)
- Primary Database (99.95% SLA)
- Message Queue (99.9% SLA)

## Degraded Mode (Non-blocking)
Service continues with reduced functionality:

- [ ] Verify SLAs being met
- [ ] Review any new dependencies added
- [ ] Update cost tracking
- [ ] Check for deprecation notices

#### Automated Monitoring
```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-check.yml
name: Dependency Health Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 9am
    
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check External APIs
        run: |
          curl -f https://api.service.com/health || exit 1
          
      - name: Check Internal Services
        run: |

```

## Dependency Risk Matrix

| Dependency | Criticality | Likelihood of Failure | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|---------|------------|
| Auth API | Blocking | Low | High | Circuit breaker, cache sessions |
| Database | Blocking | Low | High | Read replicas, connection pool |
| External API | High | Medium | Medium | Fallback service, queue |
| NPM Package | Medium | Low | Low | Lock versions, security scan |
| Team Approval | Medium | Medium | Medium | Early engagement, backup approver |

## Fallback Strategies

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```javascript
class CircuitBreaker {
  constructor(service, threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {
    this.service = service;
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.threshold = threshold;
    this.timeout = timeout;
    this.state = 'CLOSED';
  }
  
  async call(...args) {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      return this.fallback(...args);
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await this.service(...args);
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Graceful Degradation
```typescript
async function enhancedSearch(query: string) {
  try {
    // Try AI-powered search
    return await aiSearch(query);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('AI search failed, falling back');
    try {
      // Fallback to elasticsearch
      return await elasticSearch(query);
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Elastic failed, using basic search');
      // Final fallback to database
      return await basicDBSearch(query);
    }
  }
}
```

## Communication Templates

### Dependency Request
```markdown
Subject: Dependency Request: [Your Project] needs [Their Service]

Hi [Owner],

**Project:** [Name]
**Timeline:** Need by [Date]
**Dependency:** [Specific requirement]

**What we need:**
- [Specific API endpoint or resource]
- [Expected SLA]
- [Data format/volume]

**Impact if delayed:**
[Business impact]

Can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Blocker Notification
```markdown
Subject: BLOCKED: [Project] waiting on [Dependency]

**Blocked since:** [Date/time]
**Impact:** [Cannot proceed with X]
**Attempted solutions:**
1. [What you tried]
2. [What else you tried]

**Need:**
[Specific action required]

**Deadline:** [When this becomes critical]

Please advise on timeline or alternatives.
```

## Tools and Automation

### Dependency Scanner
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scan-dependencies.sh

echo "Scanning project dependencies..."

# Check package.json
if [ -f package.json ]; then
  echo "NPM Dependencies:"
  npm list --depth=0
  npm audit
fi

# Check requirements.txt
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then
  echo "Python Dependencies:"
  pip list
  safety check
fi

# Check Dockerfile
if [ -f Dockerfile ]; then
  echo "Docker Base Images:"
  grep FROM Dockerfile
fi

# Check API calls
echo "External API Calls:"
grep -r "fetch\|axios\|http" src/ | grep -E "https?://"

# Check environment variables
echo "Required Environment Variables:"
grep -r "process.env\|os.environ" src/
```

### Update Tracking
```sql
-- Track dependency changes over time
CREATE TABLE dependency_history (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  project VARCHAR(100),
  dependency VARCHAR(200),
  version VARCHAR(50),
  added_date DATE,
  removed_date DATE,
  criticality VARCHAR(20),
  owner VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Query for current dependencies
SELECT * FROM dependency_history 
WHERE removed_date IS NULL
ORDER BY criticality DESC, added_date ASC;
```

## Metrics to Track

### Health Metrics
- Dependency availability (uptime %)
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate
- Cost per dependency

### Risk Metrics
- Single points of failure count
- Dependencies without fallbacks
- External dependencies count
- Average dependency age

### Process Metrics
- Time to identify dependencies
- Blocker resolution time
- False dependency rate
- Dependency drift over time

---

*"Map everything, assume nothing, prepare for failure."*

**Key Principle:** Every dependency is a potential point of failure. Document it, monitor it, and have a plan when it fails.

## Common Handoff Failures

### Problem: Incomplete Context
**Symptoms:** New owner asks basic questions repeatedly
**Prevention:** Use handoff template, require acceptance signoff
**Recovery:** Schedule knowledge transfer session

### Problem: Missing Access
**Symptoms:** New owner blocked on day 1
**Prevention:** Access checklist in template
**Recovery:** Emergency access grant process

### Problem: Unclear Priorities
**Symptoms:** New owner works on wrong things
**Prevention:** Explicit "next 3 tasks" in handoff
**Recovery:** Daily standup for first week

### Problem: Hidden Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Unexpected breakage after handoff
**Prevention:** Dependency mapping required
**Recovery:** Previous owner on-call for 1 week

## Handoff Communication

### Announcement Template
```slack
üìã **Handoff Complete: [Project Name]**

**Previous Owner:** @old-owner ‚Üí **New Owner:** @new-owner

**Current Stage:** [Gate]
**Next Milestone:** [What]
**Target Date:** [When]

@new-owner is now driving this forward. Please direct all questions to them.

@old-owner remains available for questions through [date].

*"Clear handoffs prevent dropped balls."*

**Golden Rule:** The handoff isn't complete until the new owner successfully ships their first change.

## 31. CHARTER ACCEPTANCE TESTS

# Charter Acceptance Test Plan
*Version: 1.0 | Generated: 2025-08-31*

## Purpose
Define observable signals that prove the Operating Charter is working as designed over 14/30/60 day periods.

## Success Criteria Overview

### üéØ Target State (60 days)
- Stage gates fully adopted
- WIP limits self-enforcing
- Cadences have >90% participation
- Kill switches prevent waste
- Ship velocity increased 25%

## 14-Day Validation

### Observable Signals
```yaml
adoption_metrics:
  stage_gate_labeling:
    target: ">80% of issues labeled"
    measure: "GitHub issue count with gate labels"
    query: |
      SELECT COUNT(*) filter (WHERE labels @> '["spark","seed","scaffold","ship","scale"]')
      / COUNT(*) as label_rate
      FROM issues
      WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days'
  
  daily_standup_participation:
    target: ">70% team participating"
    measure: "Slack thread responses"
    query: "Count unique users in #unblock-and-commit"
  
  demo_friday_attendance:
    target: ">50% team attending"
    measure: "Meeting attendance + recording views"
    
  wip_violations:
    target: "<5 violations"
    measure: "Count of WIP limit breaches"
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Gate Progression Flow
```gherkin
Given a new feature idea is submitted
When it enters the Spark gate
Then it appears in the Idea Ledger
And has scoring assigned within 48 hours
And progresses to Seed within 7 days or is killed
```

#### Test 2: Daily Cadence
```gherkin
Given it is 10:00 AM PST on a weekday
When the Unblock & Commit thread is posted
Then >70% of active contributors respond by 10:15
And blockers are tagged with owners
And yesterday's commitments are addressed
```

#### Test 3: WIP Limit Enforcement
```gherkin
Given a pod has 3 items in Scaffold
When someone tries to promote a 4th item
Then the GitHub Action blocks the promotion
And suggests items to complete first
And the item remains in Seed
```

### Pass/Fail Criteria (Day 14)

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| Gate adoption | >80% | 60-80% | <60% |
| Daily participation | >70% | 50-70% | <50% |
| Demo submissions | >3/week | 2-3/week | <2/week |
| Blockers resolved | <24hrs | 24-48hrs | >48hrs |
| Kill switches triggered | >0 | 0 | N/A |

## 30-Day Validation

### Observable Signals
```yaml
velocity_metrics:
  cycle_time:
    target: "20% reduction"
    measure: "Spark to Ship duration"
    baseline: "Current average: 28 days"
    
  items_shipped:
    target: ">10 items"
    measure: "Count of Ship gate completions"
    
  quality_metrics:
    target: "100% pass Minimum Remarkable"
    measure: "Checklist completion rate"

process_health:
  portfolio_council_decisions:
    target: "2 strategic decisions made"
    measure: "Decision memos approved"
    
  idea_ledger_growth:
    target: ">30 new ideas"
    measure: "Idea Ledger entries"
    
  cross_pod_collaboration:
    target: ">5 instances"
    measure: "Cross-pod dependencies resolved"
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 4: End-to-End Feature Delivery
```gherkin
Given a feature starts in Spark on Day 1
When it progresses through all gates
Then it reaches Ship within 21 days
And meets all Minimum Remarkable criteria
And has zero rollbacks in production
```

#### Test 5: Portfolio Council Effectiveness
```gherkin
Given the monthly Portfolio Council meets
When a strategic decision is needed
Then 3 paths are presented
And one decision is made within the meeting
And action items are completed before next council
```

#### Test 6: Kill Switch Value
```gherkin
Given a project meets kill criteria
When the kill switch activates
Then resources are freed within 48 hours
And learnings are documented
And components are salvaged
And team moves to higher-priority work
```

### Pass/Fail Criteria (Day 30)

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| Cycle time reduction | >20% | 10-20% | <10% |
| Items shipped | >10 | 5-10 | <5 |
| Remarkable compliance | 100% | 90-99% | <90% |
| Kill switch activations | 2-5 | 1 or >5 | 0 |
| Idea velocity | >1/day | 0.5-1/day | <0.5/day |

## 60-Day Validation

### Observable Signals
```yaml
business_impact:
  customer_satisfaction:
    target: ">4.5/5"
    measure: "NPS and feedback scores"
    
  revenue_impact:
    target: "Features driving >$50k MRR"
    measure: "Revenue attribution"
    
  team_health:
    target: "Engagement score >4/5"
    measure: "Pulse survey results"

system_maturity:
  self_organization:
    target: ">90% autonomous progression"
    measure: "Gates progressed without intervention"
    
  prediction_accuracy:
    target: ">80% delivery predictions met"
    measure: "Committed vs actual delivery dates"
    
  waste_reduction:
    target: ">30% reduction in abandoned work"
    measure: "Work started but not shipped"
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 7: System Self-Sufficiency
```gherkin
Given the Operating Charter has been active for 60 days
When measuring system autonomy
Then >90% of gate progressions happen automatically
And <10% require manual intervention
And teams self-organize around WIP limits
```

#### Test 8: Value Delivery
```gherkin
Given 60 days of operation
When measuring business impact
Then shipped features generate measurable value
And customer satisfaction increases
And team velocity is predictable
And strategic goals are advanced
```

### Pass/Fail Criteria (Day 60)

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| System autonomy | >90% | 75-90% | <75% |
| Prediction accuracy | >80% | 60-80% | <60% |
| Team engagement | >4/5 | 3.5-4/5 | <3.5/5 |
| Revenue impact | >$50k | $25-50k | <$25k |
| Waste reduction | >30% | 15-30% | <15% |
