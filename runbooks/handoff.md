# Check GitHub
echo -n "GitHub: "
gh auth status &>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

# Check AWS
echo -n "AWS: "
aws sts get-caller-identity &>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

# Check database
echo -n "Database: "
psql -c "SELECT 1" &>/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå"

# Check monitoring
echo -n "Monitoring: "

echo "Access verification complete"
```

## Common Handoff Failures

### Problem: Incomplete Context
**Symptoms:** New owner asks basic questions repeatedly
**Prevention:** Use handoff template, require acceptance signoff
**Recovery:** Schedule knowledge transfer session

### Problem: Missing Access
**Symptoms:** New owner blocked on day 1
**Prevention:** Access checklist in template
**Recovery:** Emergency access grant process

### Problem: Unclear Priorities
**Symptoms:** New owner works on wrong things
**Prevention:** Explicit "next 3 tasks" in handoff
**Recovery:** Daily standup for first week

### Problem: Hidden Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Unexpected breakage after handoff
**Prevention:** Dependency mapping required
**Recovery:** Previous owner on-call for 1 week

*"Clear handoffs prevent dropped balls."*

**Golden Rule:** The handoff isn't complete until the new owner successfully ships their first change.
