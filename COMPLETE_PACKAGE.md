# 1. STAKEHOLDER REVIEW GUIDE

# Operating System Review Guide - Tyler, Aaron, James

## Quick Context (2 min read)

I've built an operating system to help us ship predictably without losing our creative edge. Think of it as "infrastructure for velocity" - not bureaucracy, but acceleration rails.

**Core insight:** We're great at 0‚Üí1 and polish. We need a system that handles the middle mile so we can focus on what we do best.

## Your Review Focus

### Tyler - Technical Feasibility & Developer Experience
**Time needed:** 20 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **GitHub Integration** (`.github/` folder)
   - Will these workflows actually help or create friction?
   - Are the templates practical for real development?
   - Check `stage-gates.yaml` - is this automatable?

2. **Technical Artifacts**
   - `pods/crown-trophy/engraving-flow.md` - Does the SQS/Temporal approach make sense?
   - `pods/ratio/ops-telemetry-mvp.yaml` - Realistic for brewing ops?
   - WIP limits in practice - will devs revolt?

3. **Developer Rhythm**
   - Daily Unblock & Commit - too much overhead?
   - Demo Friday format - sustainable?

**Key Question:** *"Would you actually want to work in this system?"*

### Aaron - Product Strategy & Customer Value
**Time needed:** 15 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **Stage Gates** (`Charter.md` sections 2-3)
   - Do these gates map to real product development?
   - Will this help or hinder product iteration speed?

2. **Minimum Remarkable** (`minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`)
   - Is this bar too high? Too low?
   - Does it capture what makes products worth shipping?

3. **Pod Artifacts**
   - `pods/paintbox/scope-map-v1.md` - Are these the right priorities?
   - `pods/promoteros/relationship-cadence.yaml` - Will this drive revenue?

**Key Question:** *"Will this help us ship better products faster?"*

### James - Business Impact & Scalability
**Time needed:** 15 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **ROI & Metrics** (`validation/charter-acceptance-test.md`)
   - Are the success metrics realistic?
   - 60-day targets achievable?
   - What's the real cost of implementation?

2. **Portfolio Management** (`Charter.md` + `decision-memos/`)
   - Portfolio Council structure - efficient use of time?
   - 3-paths decision framework - practical?
   - Kill switches - will we actually use them?

3. **Scale Implications**
   - Works at 10 people, but what about 50?
   - How does this affect hiring/onboarding?
   - Customer impact of this structure?

**Key Question:** *"Is the juice worth the squeeze?"*

## How to Review

### Option A: Speed Run (5 minutes)
1. Read `README_START_HERE.md` - the 30-minute adoption guide
2. Skim `Charter.md` - just the Executive Summary and Stage Gates
3. Check one pod artifact relevant to you

### Option B: Deep Dive (30 minutes)
1. Start with `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` for the full picture
2. Read `Charter.md` completely
3. Review `stage-gates.yaml` for automation details
4. Check `rollout/30-60-90-plan.md` for implementation reality
5. Look at your specific focus areas above

### Option C: Practical Test (15 minutes)
1. Pick one of your current projects
2. Try to map it to a stage gate
3. Run through the `minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`
4. Would the daily/weekly cadences help or hurt?

## Specific Feedback Needed

### Must Have Answers
1. **Deal Breakers:** What would make this system fail?
2. **Missing Pieces:** What critical element is absent?
3. **Oversights:** Where am I being naive?

### Nice to Have
1. **Improvements:** What would make this 10x better?
2. **Shortcuts:** What can we simplify without losing value?
3. **Quick Wins:** What should we implement first?

## Response Format

**Best:** 15-minute call to walk through your reactions
**Good:** Slack DM with bullet points
**Fine:** Comments in thread

## Implementation Options

### A. Full Send (Recommended if feedback positive)
- Monday: Announce to team
- Tuesday: Start daily standups
- Friday: First Demo Friday
- 30 days: Full system running

### B. Pilot Pod (Lower risk)
- Choose one pod (suggest Crown Trophy)
- Run for 30 days
- Measure everything
- Expand if successful

### C. Cherry Pick (Safest)
- Just implement Demo Friday first
- Add daily standups week 2
- Layer in gates gradually
- Full system over 60 days

## The Real Question

**"Does this system help us become the company we want to be?"**

Not perfect, not complete, but directionally correct and iteratively improvable.

---

*Review by: Friday EOD ideally*
*Decision: Monday Portfolio Council (or just us if you prefer)*

**Remember:** This is v1. We'll iterate based on what we learn. The goal is sustainable velocity, not perfection.

## Slack Message to Send

```
@tyler @aaron @james 

Built out our operating system draft - the infrastructure for shipping predictably without killing creativity.

**The gist:** Stage gates (Spark‚ÜíSeed‚ÜíScaffold‚ÜíShip‚ÜíScale) + WIP limits + daily standups + Demo Fridays + kill switches for zombie projects.

**Quick review:** `/candlefish-spine/STAKEHOLDER_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` (this doc)
**Full explore:** `/candlefish-spine/README_START_HERE.md`
**Deep dive:** `/candlefish-spine/Charter.md`

**Need your take on:**
- Tyler: Will devs revolt? Is the GitHub automation realistic?
- Aaron: Does this help or hurt product velocity? 
- James: Worth the implementation cost? Scalable?

**Time needed:** 15-20 min to review, 15 min to discuss

Can we sync Friday afternoon? Or async feedback works too.

Not married to any of this - let's make it work for us.

# üöÄ Candlefish Operating System - Start Here

**Time to adopt: 30 minutes**  
**Time to mastery: 30 days**

## What This Is

The Candlefish Operating System codifies how we ship remarkable products predictably. It's not bureaucracy‚Äîit's acceleration infrastructure.

## Quick Start (10 minutes)

### 1. Understand the Core Loop (2 min)
```
Spark ‚Üí Seed ‚Üí Scaffold ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Scale
  ‚Üë                                ‚Üì
  ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Kill Switch (if needed) ‚Üê‚îÄ
```

Every piece of work flows through these gates. No exceptions.

### 2. Label Your Current Work (3 min)
Look at what you're working on right now. Which stage is it in?

- **Spark**: Just an idea, exploring feasibility
- **Seed**: Validating technical approach
- **Scaffold**: Building core functionality  
- **Ship**: Polishing for production
- **Scale**: Optimizing what's live

Add the appropriate label to your GitHub issues/PRs.

### 3. Join Tomorrow's Standup (2 min)
At 10:00 AM PST, post in #unblock-and-commit:

```
‚úÖ Completed Yesterday: [What you finished]
üöß Blocked On: [What's stopping you, tag owner]
üìù Committing Today: [What you'll complete]
```

### 4. Book Demo Friday Slot (2 min)
If you'll ship something this week, claim a Demo Friday slot in #demo-friday.
Remember: Live demos only, no slides.

### 5. Add One Idea (1 min)
Think of one improvement, feature, or fix. Add it to the Idea Ledger (link in #operations).

**Congrats! You're now operating in the system.** üéâ

## FAQ

### "This feels like too much process"
It's actually less process‚Äîit's just visible now. You're already doing these things; we're making them systematic so you don't have to think about them.

### "What if I don't know what gate something is in?"
Ask in #operations or DM @integrator-pod. When in doubt, start with Spark.

### "Do I have to do the daily standup?"
Yes, but it takes 2 minutes. The ROI is huge‚Äîblockers get resolved faster.

### "What if I can't demo on Friday?"
That's fine! Demo when you have something to show. But aim for at least once a month.

### "Can I skip gates?"
No. Gates ensure quality and prevent waste. But gates can progress quickly if criteria are met.

### "Who decides gate progression?"
- Spark ‚Üí Seed: You + Pod Lead
- Seed ‚Üí Scaffold: Integrator Pod
- Scaffold ‚Üí Ship: Pod Lead + Integrator Pod
- Ship ‚Üí Scale: Portfolio Council

### "What if something gets killed?"
That's success, not failure. We learned something and freed resources for better work.

# 3. OPERATING CHARTER

# Candlefish Operating Charter
*Version 1.0 | Generated: 2025-08-31*

## Executive Summary

Candlefish operates as a dual-engine organization: Patrick drives Spark & Elevation while our System delivers Integration & Finish. This charter codifies how we ship remarkable products predictably without sacrificing creative edge.

## Operating Archetype

### Dual-Engine Model
- **Engine 1: Spark & Elevation** (Patrick)
  - 0‚Üí1 creation
  - Polish passes
  - Strategic vision
  - Quality elevation

- **Engine 2: Integration & Finish** (System)
  - Middle-mile execution
  - Cross-pod coordination
  - Delivery cadence
  - Operational excellence

## Stage-Gate Framework

### Gate Progression
**Spark ‚Üí Seed ‚Üí Scaffold ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Scale**

Each gate enforces explicit criteria before promotion. No skipping gates. Kill-switches activate automatically on criteria breach.

### Gate Definitions

#### Spark Gate
- **Purpose**: Capture and qualify ideas
- **Entry**: Problem statement + hypothesis
- **Exit**: Strategic fit score ‚â•3/5, Impact ‚â•3/5
- **Artifacts**: Idea Ledger entry, initial POV
- **Review**: Weekly during Unblock & Commit
- **Auto-kill**: No progress for 30 days

#### Seed Gate
- **Purpose**: Validate feasibility
- **Entry**: Approved Spark
- **Exit**: Technical spike complete, dependency map
- **Artifacts**: Decision Memo, risk assessment
- **Review**: Integrator Pod sign-off
- **Auto-kill**: Blocking dependencies unresolved for 14 days

#### Scaffold Gate
- **Purpose**: Build foundation
- **Entry**: Approved Seed with owner assigned
- **Exit**: Core functionality working, test coverage >60%
- **Artifacts**: API contracts, acceptance tests, demo recording
- **Review**: Demo Friday presentation
