## Demo Qualification Reminder

```
💡 **What Makes a Valid Demo?**

Seeing confusion about demo requirements. Quick reminder:

✅ **Valid:**
• Live software (even if rough)
• Real user interactions
• Actual data/API calls
• Failed experiments with learnings
• Performance improvements

❌ **Not Valid:**
• Slides/presentations
• Mockups/designs
• Future plans
• Status updates
• "It works on my machine" without showing

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't let someone else try it, it's not ready to demo.
