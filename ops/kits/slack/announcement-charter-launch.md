ðŸ“‹ **Candlefish Operating Charter Now Live**

Team,

We're institutionalizing how we ship remarkable products predictably. The new Operating Charter codifies our dual-engine model and stage-gate framework.

**What's New:**
â€¢ **Stage Gates**: Spark â†’ Seed â†’ Scaffold â†’ Ship â†’ Scale progression
â€¢ **WIP Limits**: Max 3 items per pod in Scaffold
â€¢ **Daily Cadence**: Unblock & Commit at 10am PST
â€¢ **Demo Friday**: Required for Ship gate promotion
â€¢ **Kill Switches**: Automatic triggers for stalled work

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Review the Charter: [Link to Charter.md]
2. Label your current work with stage gates
3. Join tomorrow's Unblock & Commit
4. Sign up for Demo Friday if shipping this week

**Key Links:**
â€¢ Full Charter: `/candlefish-spine/Charter.md`
â€¢ Stage Gates: `/candlefish-spine/stage-gates.yaml`
â€¢ Minimum Remarkable: `/candlefish-spine/minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`

This isn't bureaucracyâ€”it's how we maintain velocity while shipping quality. The system handles the integration so you can focus on creation.

Questions? â†’ #operations or DM @integrator-pod

Let's ship remarkable things. ðŸš€

Great question about [topic]. 

The short answer: [Answer]

Happy to discuss further in our next sync.

### Resistance Response
```
I hear the concern about process overhead.

The system is designed to reduce friction, not add it:
â€¢ Gates auto-progress when criteria are met
â€¢ WIP limits prevent context-switching 
â€¢ Kill switches free you from zombie projects

Let's try it for 30 days and adjust based on data.
