# 🚀 Candlefish Operating System - Start Here

**Time to adopt: 30 minutes**  
**Time to mastery: 30 days**

## What This Is

The Candlefish Operating System codifies how we ship remarkable products predictably. It's not bureaucracy—it's acceleration infrastructure.

## Quick Start (10 minutes)

### 1. Understand the Core Loop (2 min)
```
Spark → Seed → Scaffold → Ship → Scale
  ↑                                ↓
  ←───── Kill Switch (if needed) ←─
```

Every piece of work flows through these gates. No exceptions.

### 2. Label Your Current Work (3 min)
Look at what you're working on right now. Which stage is it in?

- **Spark**: Just an idea, exploring feasibility
- **Seed**: Validating technical approach
- **Scaffold**: Building core functionality  
- **Ship**: Polishing for production
- **Scale**: Optimizing what's live

Add the appropriate label to your GitHub issues/PRs.

### 3. Join Tomorrow's Standup (2 min)
At 10:00 AM PST, post in #unblock-and-commit:

```
✅ Completed Yesterday: [What you finished]
🚧 Blocked On: [What's stopping you, tag owner]
📝 Committing Today: [What you'll complete]
```

### 4. Book Demo Friday Slot (2 min)
If you'll ship something this week, claim a Demo Friday slot in #demo-friday.
Remember: Live demos only, no slides.

### 5. Add One Idea (1 min)
Think of one improvement, feature, or fix. Add it to the Idea Ledger (link in #operations).

**Congrats! You're now operating in the system.** 🎉

## FAQ

### "This feels like too much process"
It's actually less process—it's just visible now. You're already doing these things; we're making them systematic so you don't have to think about them.

### "What if I don't know what gate something is in?"
Ask in #operations or DM @integrator-pod. When in doubt, start with Spark.

### "Do I have to do the daily standup?"
Yes, but it takes 2 minutes. The ROI is huge—blockers get resolved faster.

### "What if I can't demo on Friday?"
That's fine! Demo when you have something to show. But aim for at least once a month.

### "Can I skip gates?"
No. Gates ensure quality and prevent waste. But gates can progress quickly if criteria are met.

### "Who decides gate progression?"
- Spark → Seed: You + Pod Lead
- Seed → Scaffold: Integrator Pod
- Scaffold → Ship: Pod Lead + Integrator Pod
- Ship → Scale: Portfolio Council

### "What if something gets killed?"
That's success, not failure. We learned something and freed resources for better work.
