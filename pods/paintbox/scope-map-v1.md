## User Stories (Top 3 to Ship)

### Story 1: Quick Quote to Contract
```gherkin
Feature: Convert estimate to contract in one flow

  As a painting contractor
  I want to create an estimate and convert it to a contract
  So that I can close deals faster

  Scenario: Create and send estimate
    Given I have a new client inquiry
    When I create an estimate with line items
    And I add photos and scope details
    Then I can send it via email/SMS
    And track when it's viewed

  Scenario: Client accepts estimate
    Given client views the estimate
    When they click "Accept"
    Then it converts to a contract
    And collects digital signature
    And schedules initial payment

  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Estimate creation <2 minutes
    - Mobile-responsive client view
    - Legal contract generation
    - Payment processing integration
    - Email/SMS notifications
```

### Story 2: Photo Progress Documentation
```gherkin
Feature: Document project progress with photos

  As a painting contractor
  I want to capture progress photos easily
  So that I can document work for clients and protect myself

  Scenario: Capture before/during/after
    Given I'm on a job site
    When I open the mobile app
    Then I can capture photos with labels
    And they auto-organize by project/room
    And sync when connection available

  Scenario: Share with client
    Given I have progress photos
    When I select photos to share
    Then client receives update
    And can comment/approve
    And history is maintained

  Acceptance Criteria:

    - Automatic GPS/timestamp
    - Room/area tagging
    - Batch upload when online
    - Client portal access
```

### Story 3: Intelligent Scheduling
```gherkin
Feature: Smart crew and project scheduling

  As a painting contractor
  I want to efficiently schedule crews
  So that I maximize productivity and minimize downtime

  Scenario: Schedule multi-day project
    Given I have a 5-day project
    When I assign crew members
    Then system checks availability
    And warns of conflicts
    And suggests optimal schedule

  Scenario: Handle weather delays
    Given rain is forecast
    When I check schedule
    Then system shows affected jobs
    And suggests rescheduling options
    And notifies affected parties

  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Drag-drop calendar interface
    - Crew availability tracking
