            Hi {venue_contact_name},
            
            I noticed {venue_name} has been hosting {event_type} events. 
            We specialize in matching venues with proven artists that drive 
            {specific_metric: bar sales, ticket sales, foot traffic}.
            
            Our recent show at {similar_venue} saw {impressive_metric}.
            
            Worth a quick call to discuss your {timeframe} calendar?
