# Decision Memo: Mobile Photo Capture Workflow
*Date: 2025-08-31 | Owner: Lisa Park | Status: Approved*

## Context
Field teams document 500+ items daily using consumer camera apps then manually upload, causing 2-hour daily overhead and frequent data loss. Current workflow has 15% error rate and blocks real-time inventory updates.

## Decision Required
Should we build native mobile apps or use progressive web app (PWA) approach?

## Three Paths

### Path 1: Native iOS/Android Apps
**Description:** Build dedicated React Native apps for both platforms.

**Pros:**
- Best camera integration
- Offline-first architecture  
- Push notifications
- App store presence

**Cons:**
- App store approval delays
- Update distribution challenges
- Dual platform maintenance
- Device testing matrix

**Cost:** $80k development + $20k/year maintenance
**Timeline:** 12 weeks

### Path 2: Progressive Web App (PWA)
**Description:** Enhance existing web app with PWA capabilities and camera APIs.

**Pros:**
- Single codebase
- Instant updates
- No app store friction
- Works on any device

**Cons:**
- iOS camera limitations
- No app store discovery
- Browser compatibility issues
- Less native feel

**Cost:** $30k development + $5k/year maintenance
**Timeline:** 4 weeks

### Path 3: Hybrid - PWA First, Native Later
**Description:** Launch PWA immediately, develop native apps for power users.

**Pros:**
- Quick initial deployment
- Learn from PWA usage
- Progressive enhancement
- Risk mitigation

**Cons:**
- Eventually maintaining both
- Potential user confusion
- Feature parity challenges
- Longer total timeline

**Cost:** $35k PWA + $60k native later
**Timeline:** 4 weeks PWA, +8 weeks native

## Recommendation
**Path 2: Progressive Web App**

Rationale:
- 3x faster time to value
- Covers 95% of use cases adequately
- Can always add native if needed
- Dramatically lower maintenance burden
- Recent iOS improvements make PWA viable

## Reversibility
**Easily reversible** - PWA components can be wrapped in React Native shell if native becomes necessary.

## Success Metrics
1. Photo capture time reduced by 50%
2. Error rate reduced to <2%
3. 100% of field team using within 30 days
4. Zero data loss incidents
5. Offline sync success rate >98%

## Next Steps
1. Implement MediaStream API integration
2. Add service worker for offline
3. Deploy to staging for field testing
4. Create training materials
5. Phased rollout by region
