# Operating System Review Guide - Tyler, Aaron, James

## Quick Context (2 min read)

I've built an operating system to help us ship predictably without losing our creative edge. Think of it as "infrastructure for velocity" - not bureaucracy, but acceleration rails.

**Core insight:** We're great at 0→1 and polish. We need a system that handles the middle mile so we can focus on what we do best.

## Your Review Focus

### Tyler - Technical Feasibility & Developer Experience
**Time needed:** 20 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **GitHub Integration** (`.github/` folder)
   - Will these workflows actually help or create friction?
   - Are the templates practical for real development?
   - Check `stage-gates.yaml` - is this automatable?

2. **Technical Artifacts**
   - `pods/crown-trophy/engraving-flow.md` - Does the SQS/Temporal approach make sense?
   - `pods/ratio/ops-telemetry-mvp.yaml` - Realistic for brewing ops?
   - WIP limits in practice - will devs revolt?

3. **Developer Rhythm**
   - Daily Unblock & Commit - too much overhead?
   - Demo Friday format - sustainable?

**Key Question:** *"Would you actually want to work in this system?"*

### Aaron - Product Strategy & Customer Value
**Time needed:** 15 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **Stage Gates** (`Charter.md` sections 2-3)
   - Do these gates map to real product development?
   - Will this help or hinder product iteration speed?

2. **Minimum Remarkable** (`minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`)
   - Is this bar too high? Too low?
   - Does it capture what makes products worth shipping?

3. **Pod Artifacts**
   - `pods/paintbox/scope-map-v1.md` - Are these the right priorities?
   - `pods/promoteros/relationship-cadence.yaml` - Will this drive revenue?

**Key Question:** *"Will this help us ship better products faster?"*

### James - Business Impact & Scalability
**Time needed:** 15 minutes  
**Focus on:**
1. **ROI & Metrics** (`validation/charter-acceptance-test.md`)
   - Are the success metrics realistic?
   - 60-day targets achievable?
   - What's the real cost of implementation?

2. **Portfolio Management** (`Charter.md` + `decision-memos/`)
   - Portfolio Council structure - efficient use of time?
   - 3-paths decision framework - practical?
   - Kill switches - will we actually use them?

3. **Scale Implications**
   - Works at 10 people, but what about 50?
   - How does this affect hiring/onboarding?
   - Customer impact of this structure?

**Key Question:** *"Is the juice worth the squeeze?"*

## How to Review

### Option A: Speed Run (5 minutes)
1. Read `README_START_HERE.md` - the 30-minute adoption guide
2. Skim `Charter.md` - just the Executive Summary and Stage Gates
3. Check one pod artifact relevant to you

### Option B: Deep Dive (30 minutes)
1. Start with `DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md` for the full picture
2. Read `Charter.md` completely
3. Review `stage-gates.yaml` for automation details
4. Check `rollout/30-60-90-plan.md` for implementation reality
5. Look at your specific focus areas above

### Option C: Practical Test (15 minutes)
1. Pick one of your current projects
2. Try to map it to a stage gate
3. Run through the `minimum-remarkable-checklist.md`
4. Would the daily/weekly cadences help or hurt?

## Specific Feedback Needed

### Must Have Answers
1. **Deal Breakers:** What would make this system fail?
2. **Missing Pieces:** What critical element is absent?
3. **Oversights:** Where am I being naive?

### Nice to Have
1. **Improvements:** What would make this 10x better?
2. **Shortcuts:** What can we simplify without losing value?
3. **Quick Wins:** What should we implement first?

## Response Format

**Best:** 15-minute call to walk through your reactions
**Good:** Slack DM with bullet points
**Fine:** Comments in thread

## Implementation Options

### A. Full Send (Recommended if feedback positive)
- Monday: Announce to team
- Tuesday: Start daily standups
- Friday: First Demo Friday
- 30 days: Full system running

### B. Pilot Pod (Lower risk)
- Choose one pod (suggest Crown Trophy)
- Run for 30 days
- Measure everything
- Expand if successful

### C. Cherry Pick (Safest)
- Just implement Demo Friday first
- Add daily standups week 2
- Layer in gates gradually
- Full system over 60 days

## The Real Question

**"Does this system help us become the company we want to be?"**

Not perfect, not complete, but directionally correct and iteratively improvable.

*Review by: Friday EOD ideally*
*Decision: Monday Portfolio Council (or just us if you prefer)*

**Remember:** This is v1. We'll iterate based on what we learn. The goal is sustainable velocity, not perfection.

## Slack Message to Send

@tyler @aaron @james 

Built out our operating system draft - the infrastructure for shipping predictably without killing creativity.

**The gist:** Stage gates (Spark→Seed→Scaffold→Ship→Scale) + WIP limits + daily standups + Demo Fridays + kill switches for zombie projects.

**Quick review:** `/candlefish-spine/STAKEHOLDER_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` (this doc)
**Full explore:** `/candlefish-spine/README_START_HERE.md`
**Deep dive:** `/candlefish-spine/Charter.md`

**Need your take on:**
- Tyler: Will devs revolt? Is the GitHub automation realistic?
- Aaron: Does this help or hurt product velocity? 
- James: Worth the implementation cost? Scalable?

**Time needed:** 15-20 min to review, 15 min to discuss

Can we sync Friday afternoon? Or async feedback works too.

Not married to any of this - let's make it work for us.
